//// My own rating on the functionality ///////////////////
Rating: A
Explanation: Code is not only fully functional (all tested cases were passed),
but also the design was excellent; an object oriented interface for blocked 
memory and error management was implemented (see WrappedFileSys.cpp/WrappedFileSys.h).
