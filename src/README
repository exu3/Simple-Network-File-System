### My own rating on the functionality
Rating: A
Explanation:
    - Code is fully functional (all tested cases and handles edge cases)
    - Robust design. We created an object oriented interface (wrapped classes)
      for disk block management and error handling (see WrappedFileSys.cpp and
      WrappedFileSys.h). Easy to maintain and read
    - Resistant to unexpected failures (power outages, etc.)
    - Tested and works with three other servers and clients
